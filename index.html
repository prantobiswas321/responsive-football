            <h1 class="his-header">The History of Copa America</h1>
            <p class="his-data">The Copa América is the oldest football competition of national teams in the world. It
                was
                disputed for
                the
                first time in a trial edition in 1910, but it had its first official edition between July 2 and 17,
                1916, as
                part of the commemorations of the centennial of Argentina's independence. In addition to the host
                country,
                Chile, Uruguay and Brazil also participated.
                From its first edition until 1967 the tournament was called the Campeonato Sudamericano de Selecciones..
                In the first edition, Uruguay won the championship, after a 0-0 match against Argentina in the final
                played at the Racing Club of Avellaneda stadium.
                Since 1975, in its 30th edition, the tournament was officially called Copa América. With the change of
                name there were also changes in the dispute system. The point-by-point system was replaced by a format
                similar to that of the FIFA World Cup: qualifying phase, with the selections distributed in groups,
                followed by qualifying rounds.</p>
